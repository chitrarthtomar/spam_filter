Oh, yes.  Please, I would be thrilled to accept
10 million dollars.  Please send me your credit
card and bank numbers, and I will reserve you a
first-class airline ticket to visit Europe and
meet you there.  I can be at the Schipohl airport
in Amsterdam next Tuesday.  Please send me your
MasterCard charge account, and your bank checking
account and routing number.

So sorry to hear about your father.  He was
a great man, and is sorely missed.  

I appreciate your willingness to donate to
my foundation.  The children of the world who are 
starving for intellectual stimulation will praise
your name!

My name is Danjuma Sule, one of the sons of major Gen Gumel Danjuma Sule,
The late Nigeria's former minister of mines and power in the regime of the
late former Nigeria's military Head of state, Gen
Sanni Abacha. 

He married my mother on the agreement that my mother,Amina Fausat Sule,
will maintain her family's name together with her children. Before he died
in the German hospital on the 15th of November 1988 where he went to
operate on the cancer of the knee, he fixed the Sum of $30,000.000.00 in
the Central Bank of Nigeria under Intartrade Ventures Ltd on behalf of my
mother. The 3 yrs maturity period placed on the money is due but the
problem we are having now is that we lost the whole of the documents as a
result of fire, which gutted our house
3 months ago. 

We have discussed with our family attorney on how to collect the money
with out hitches, he advised us to liaise with a foreigner who will act as
the foreign partner of Intartrade Ventures Ltd and will purport that The
money in question is urgently needed overseas for an important project. 

It is on this basis I am seeking for assistance. Your percentage is
negotiable. Please note; your age and profession doesn't really matter in
this transaction. Waiting for your immediate response.

Regards, 
Danjuma Sule

ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR

Tell:(225)07 62 53 48
         
 Sir,             BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

I do recognize the surprise this urgent letter will
bring to you especially
as it came from a stranger.  First, I must introduce
myself.  I am DR IDAMACO HASSAN from the Diamond-Rich
district of Kono, Sierra Leone, and my
father was the former Special Adviser to the ousted
Head of State of Sierra
Leone, Major Johnny Paul Koroma.  I got your Email
address and other details
from the International Chamber of Commerce here in
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire

During the war between our forces led by the Ex-Head
of State, Major Johnny
Koroma and the West African Allied Forces (ECOMOG), my
country relied
heavily on the foreign earnings generated from diamond
trade.  This money
was personally kept by the then President, Major
Johnny Paul Koroma since
our banking system had collapsed during the war.

However, as the war progressed, it became apparent
that we were going to
loose the war to the superior and better armed West
African Allied Forces
(ECOMOG).  At this point, the key officers of the
administration started
making frantic efforts on how to leave Sierra Leone
safely thereby sharing
the proceeds/money from this diamond trade.  In view
of the fact that my
father was one of the key officers of the then
administration and an In-law
to Major Paul Koroma, he succeeded in getting the sum
of US$18 Million
(Eighteen Million United States Dollars).

We made arrangement and transferred the money through
diplomatic means to
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire, where I am presently living in
exile as an asylum seeker but
unfortunately, my father died of heart attack after a
few months of exile in
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire and automatically, I came in
total control of the said money as
the only surviving son.  Upon our arrival in Abidjan
Cote D'Ivoire after due
consideration, we deposited the money with a security
company for security
reasons.  The actual content was not disclosed to them
(security company)
pending when we see a trustworthy person such as
yourself who will assist us
in transferring this money to his account outside
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire, as the
strict Monetary Laws here do not allow asylum seekers
certain financial
rights.

I shall be most grateful if you can assist me
accomplish this transaction
and hoping too that you will remain trustworthy.  For
your efforts and
assistance, I have agreed to give you 20% of the total
sum while 5% will be
set aside for all the expenses incurred in the course
of this transaction.
The rest of the 75% will be for my family investment
in your country.

Please, note that I have made arrangements for
successful deal.  As such,
the only thing I ask from you is total assistance to
transfer this money,
complete trust and assurance that my own part of the
money will be safe when
transferred to your account.  I would also wish you
kept this proposal
highly confidential and secret considering my father's
position before his
death and the source of the money.  If you are
interested in assisting me,
please Call or send me an Email address as soon as
possible with the Email
address above.  Thanking you in advance for your
anticipated cooperation.

Best regards,


DR IDAMACO HASSAN

DEAR Sir
 I foresee the suprise this letter will bring to you
as it come from someone with no previous contact or
business relationship.Please consider this as a
despirate plea from someone in dire need of help and
with the best of intention for both of us. Your adress
got to me coutesy of a business jurnal at the worid
trade center in Johanesburg South Africa and after due
considration from your profile,Iam assured of your
crediblity and trust hence i decided to contact you.

 I am darba Gambo from the Republic of Sierre Leone,my
father served as the defence chief\adviser to the
ousted Head of state ,Major Poul Koromah till 1998 .He
was incharge of procurement of Arms and Ammunitions. 

But as the war progresses,it became apparant that we
will loose to the Goverment troops who were heavily
armed and barked by the West African Allied
Forces(ECOMOG) he quickly made an arrangment to
safeguard the future and life of his family and to
establish himself in a meaningful business outside my
country . He used his position to over-inflate the
cost of arms and amination purchased to the tune of
US$25M(twenty five million dollars) when the money
disbursed, he recieved the (USD$25 million )which he
locked in the family safe.

Two months later he resigned from the millitry
services and escaped with his family and the money
stashed in a safe deposite box to South Africa. We
were granted temporary political assylum with
restricted finicial right,so he could not open a bank
account or a business enterprise. However, he
succeeded in depositing the money in a private
Security Company for safekeeping and declared the box
as containing land documents and precious stones .
Later my father died and was buired in South
Africa,and iam here with my sick mother and my younger
brother .

 My aim of contacting you is to help me in transfaring
this money into your nominated account,and to help me
engage in a profitable business investment in your
country.I will offer you 25% commission if the total
fund for your assistance and services,and will also
offset any expenses you incur in the business when we
conclude with 5%.

 This business needs utmost trust and confidentiality
from you and its risk free because all the modalities
for a smooth and successful transaction have been
arranged.If you are intrested in this proposal,please
contact me immedietly for futher details and include
your private telephone  number in your reply. 

Best regards,

Darva Gambo
